Technical Experience
My Cool Side Project : For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition list can be used to have named items.

* These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
  indentation levels in the markdown source.
* Second item.
Open Source : List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on the project names, for example the Linux Kernel, where you implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or node.js (with link) which was actually totally your idea...

Programming Languages : first-lang: Here, we have an itemization, where we only want to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to mention some others together at the end. A format that works well here is a description list where the first few items have their first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few emphasized terms. 

: Basic knowledge of C, x86 assembly, forth, Common Lisp

Human Languages:
ENGLISH,TELUGU,HINDI
